# Elegance Theme

The StoreConnect Souvenir Theme is a multi-purpose theme ideal for cosmetic, clothing, or fashion industries.

This versatile design can be easily repurposed or readjusted to suit any store, offering a sophisticated and clean layout. It is specifically tailored to emphasize upsell products, encouraging customers to seamlessly navigate through your offerings. 

## Directory Structure

Developed using the [Base Theme](https://github.com/GetStoreConnect/base-theme) as a boilerplate. The Souvenir theme doesn't contain all the base theme structure, we only include those customised, modified and new templates, snippets, variables or translations. StoreConnect will always fall back to the Base Theme template when a theme does not contain its own customised equivalent template.

The theme installer is in your Salesforce org, where you must upload this theme as a zip file.
